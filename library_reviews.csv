11,Christopher Garcia,christopher.garcia@email.com,North Branch,2,Hours are terrible. You're never open when working people actually need you. Closed by 6pm on weekdays? Closed all day Sunday? Who decided these hours?,2/7/2025,Negative,Hours,New

17,Kevin Anderson,kevin.anderson@email.com,Eastside Branch,2,The children's section is way too loud. There's no enforcement of quiet areas. Parents letting kids run wild screaming while I'm trying to work. Need better policies and enforcement.,2/1/2025,Negative,Other,New
